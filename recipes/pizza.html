            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the garlic in a small square of aluminum foil. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over the garlic. Wrap foil around garlic to seal.</li>
                <li>Roast the garlic in the preheated oven until soft, about 20 minutes. Smash roasted cloves with a fork.</li>
                <li>Place the pears in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil; toss to coat. Arrange pear slices on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in hot oven until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Preheat a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
                <li>Lightly dust a flat surface with flour. Roll the prepared pizza crust dough out onto the prepared surface. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Lay the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread the mashed garlic onto the dough; top with the Swiss cheese. Arrange the pears, prosciutto, and mozzarella cheese onto the pizza. Season with salt and pepper. Brush the edges of the crust with the 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
